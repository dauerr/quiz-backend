        - Do NOT include questions or opinions ‚Äî just statements of fact.
        - Do not use any markdown, formatting, or commentary.
        - Every fact must be 100% true and verifiable.

        - Use a mix of styles (facts, pop culture tie-ins, situational/hypothetical, odd but true).
        - Each question must have exactly 4 answer choices.
        - Only one correct answer per question. Distractors must be plausible, topic-relevant, and clearly incorrect.
        - Randomize the correct answer's position across the options.
        - Keep the wording fun and engaging, while staying concise.
        - Avoid repeating facts or phrasing between questions.
        - Keep the questions short and under 60 characters.
        - The question MUST NOT include the answer.

        Output as a JSON array of question objects only, NO MARKDOWN, just raw text:
        Format:
        [
        {
            "question": "...?",

        - It is VERY important that all the information you provide is 100% correct.
        - The reply has to be parsed in the next step by the client.
        - Write all output, including options and question text, exclusively in ${language}. Do not include translations.
        - When creating questions make them harder than the questions that were asked before.
